This folder contains the codes.

I have used Python Version 3.12.1. 
The library that I have used is Pandas Version 2.2.

I have complied all these codes in Visual Studio Code.

***Do note that no data cleaning/codes were done on the "Waste Statistics and Recycling Rate".
It does not require heavy coding and hence, I have solely used Power Bi Desktop for it.
